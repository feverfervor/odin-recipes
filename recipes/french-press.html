        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A french press is a super duper duper duper easy way of making coffee. Looks all fancy schmancy, the hipsters are into it,
             but this is because it's very tasty and effective in its simplicity. Soooooooo easy. 
        </p>
        <p>It's fully manual, so it's up to YOU baby, no machines to blame if it turns out badly. It's super cheap, like $5 maybe. Where 
            did it come from? Supposedly some French dude in the 1850s was running late for work and hadn't put the coffee beans in the 
            percolater, so he figured I'll just put it on top of the boiling water and then press a filter on top. He did that. He tried it.
             It was totally incredible. Thus the French press was born.

        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First warm up the press. Boil water and rinse out the press itself.</li>
            <li>Measure and grind the beans. Going for 1:18g coffee:water. Grind the beans into consistent <em>coarse</em> grinds.</li>
            <li>Discard the water from the french press. Add the grinds. Bring the particular amount of water you need to a boil, 
                and then let it cool for a minute. THEN pour into the french press.
            </li>
            <li>Using that spoon, stir <strong>vigorously</strong> to break up the top crust thing.</li>
            <li>Let the coffee steep for like four minutes. Once that time starts a buzzing gently push the plunger all the way to the 
                bottom. And serve that stuff IMMEDIATELY. Get it OUT of there.
            </li>
            <li>Congratulations, you did it yay.</li>
