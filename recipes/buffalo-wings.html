        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Buffalo wings are these incredible incredible foods. Let me break it down for you. Traditionally they're unbreaded chicken wing 
            sections that are deep-fried and coated in a sauce made up of like cayenne pepper sauce and butter. You'll see em served 
            hot with celery, carrots, and ranch. They're so freaking good. Etymological note: they come from Buffalo, NY; no relation to the animal 
            lmao.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>10 chicken wings</li>
            <li>2 cups grass-fed tallow</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grass-fed butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt, in a <strong>big</strong> bowl.</li>
            <li>Place your chicken wings in the bowl with the flour mixture and toss those bad boys till they're
                evenly coated. Transfer them wings to a 9x13" glass baking dish and arrange em in a single layer. 
                Cover that dish and put it in the fridge for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Get out your deep heavy skillet and add about an inch of the beef tallow. Heat it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
                The oil ought to be enough to cover the wings entirely.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine the butter, hot sauce, pepper, and garlic powder in a separate saucepan 
                over low heat. Cook and stir until that butter is melted and the combination is thoroughly mixed. Remove from the heat
                 and reserve it for the serving part.
            </li>
            <li>Okay, now the time has come. Fry the coated wings in the hot ass tallow for 10 to 15 minutes, whenever they begin to 
                crisp and turn brown. Maintain the temperature while cooking. Remove the cooked wings from that hot tallow and 
                let them drain the stuff on a paper towel or a wire rack.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the wings to a platter and drizzle that hot sauce on top. </li>
            <li>OH YEAH there we go you got those WINGS mmmmm so freaking tasty gosh dang it</li>
        </ol>
